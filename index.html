# Building an image is simple, right?

* Take the dockerfile
* And build it!:

  `docker build -t .`

* Done! Oh, right, the image should have tags:

  `docker tag deadbeef myimage:latest`

* Oops, the previous latest image was overwritten, I should add some more tags:

  `docker tag myimage:latest myimage:1.0`

* Done, push to production instance!

* Oh, wait, how do I start it? What version is it running anyway?

#### Arrght, its too complicated, lets start from scratch!

# What is wrong with simple Dockerfiles

```docker
FROM centos:centos7
MAINTAINER The CentOS Project <cloud-ops@centos.org>

RUN yum -y update; yum clean all
RUN yum -y install epel-release; yum clean all
RUN yum -y install mongodb-server; yum clean all
RUN mkdir -p /data/db

EXPOSE 27017
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/mongod"]
```

1. Which version of mongo is installed?
1. Is it necessary to have a layer for each instruction?
1. Where do I find info about this package - URL, help file?
1. Why is `/data/db` being created there? Is it a mount point?
1. How do I start it with default config? with a custom config?

####Lets add the missing information

---
# Add descriptive labels

```docker
FROM centos:centos7
MAINTAINER The CentOS Project <cloud-ops@centos.org>

RUN yum -y update && \
    yum -y install epel-release \
                   mongodb-server && \
    yum clean all && \
    mkdir -p /data/db

LABEL BZComponent="mongodb"
LABEL Version="3.2.8"
LABEL Release="1"
LABEL HELP="Mongo (from 'humongous') is a high-performance, open source, schema-free document-oriented database. MongoDB is written in C++ and offers the following features: * Collection oriented storage: easy storage of object/JSON-style data * Dynamic queries * Full index support, including on inner objects and embedded arrays * Query profiling * Replication and fail-over support * Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. photos and videos) * Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (currently in early alpha) * Commercial Support Available A key goal of MongoDB is to bridge the gap between key/value stores (which are fast and highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which are deep in functionality)."
LABEL RUN="docker run -ti -v /data:/data/db mongo-centos-7:latest"

EXPOSE 27017
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/mongod"]
```

Now I should also update "Version" label whenever the package is updated

# Building a decent image manually

Build:
```
$ sudo docker build -t mongo-centos-7 .
```

Squash extra layers:
```
$ sudo docker history mongo-centos-7 .

$ sudo docker-squash -f b78336099045 -t mongo-centos-7:squashed mongo-centos-7:latest
$ sudo docker tag mongo-centos-7:squashed mongo-centos-7:latest
```

Tag with additional tags - for version, version-release and a random timestamp
```no-highlight
$ sudo docker tag mongo-centos-7:latest mongo-centos-7:3.2.8
$ sudo docker tag mongo-centos-7:latest mongo-centos-7:3.2.8-1
$ sudo docker tag mongo-centos-7:latest mongo-centos-7:20170422171656
```

Can this be automated somehow?

## Atomic Reactor
.footnote[https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-reactor]

---
# What is Atomic Reactor

Atomic Reactor is a python cli app which helps with building Docker images

Features:
1. Builds images inside a container - the builds are separated between each other
1. Plugins - allows customizing the build process

Installation:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-reactor.git
$ cd atomic-reactor
$ sudo pip install .
```
Prepare a buildroot - a docker image with necessary tools installed from a Dockerfile in 'images/dockerhost-builder':
```
$ sudo atomic-reactor create-build-image \
    --reactor-local-path . \
    ./images/dockerhost-builder \
    buildroot
```

Build a Mongodb image using this buildroot:
```
$ sudo atomic-reactor build git \
  --method hostdocker \
  --build-image buildroot \
  --image mongo-centos-7 \
  --target-registries 172.17.42.1:5000 \
  --uri "https://github.com/vrutkovs/mongodb-centos-7-docker.git"
```

---
# What's happening inside atomic-reactor

1. Atomic reactor prepares a build json:
```json
{
  "source": {
    "provider": "git",
    "provider_params": {"git_commit": "None"},
    "uri": "https://github.com/vrutkovs/mongodb-centos-7-docker.git",
    "dockerfile_path": "None"},
"image": "mongo-centos-7",
"prebuild_plugins":
    [{"args":
        {"parent_registry_insecure": "False",
         "parent_registry": "None"},
         "name": "pull_base_image"}],
"postbuild_plugins":
    [{"args":
         {"registries": {"172.17.42.1:5000": {"insecure": "False"}}},
         "name": "tag_and_push"}]
}
```
1. Atomic reactor starts a new container from buildroot image and passes the build json
1. Inside the container atomic reactor reads build json and prepares a chain of plugins to run along with parameters for them
1. The plugins are executed and the image is built

Atomic reactor is able to run a build out of a custom JSON file too:
```
$ sudo  sudo atomic-reactor --verbose build json <path to build json> --build-image buildroot --method hostdocker
```

---
# Most notable Atomic reactor plugins

1. Pre-build plugins:
    1. **pull_base_image** - makes sure the base image is always fresh
    1. **change_from_in_dockerfile** - update FROM line in dockerfile to container image ID
    1. **add_labels_in_dockerfile** - add missing labels - build date, hostname, git reference, architecture
    1. **add_dockerfile** - store the used dockerfile in the image
    1. **add_help** - convert a specified markdown file in a man page (used in `atomic help` command)
    1. **add_yum_repo_by_url** / **inject_yum_repo** - install additional repo file and remove it in the end of the build
1. Post-build and pre-publish plugins
    1. **squash** - layers created during the build are squashed into one
    1. **tag_by_labels** - tag image based on Version and Release labels
    1. **tag_from_config** - tag image with additional tags, read from `additional-tags` in the git Replication
    1. **tag_and_push** - apply tags to the image and push it to the specified repository
    1. **all_rpm_packages** - gather info about RPM packages
1. Exit plugins
    1. **koji_promote** - create a build in Koji buildsystem with a tarball of the image and required metadata
    1. **sendmail** - send an email about the status of the build

## OSBS
.footnote[OpenShift Build System]

---

# OSBS details

#### Build environment
   Openshift - can be easily extended, has monitoring and metrics. Openshift-specific objects like BuildConfig and ImageStream are used in OSBS

#### A tool which would create build jsons from a template and start builds
   [OSBS-client](https://github.com/projectatomic/osbs-client) creates a build json based on parameters, has API to be used in other projects

#### Integration with existing build system
   [Koji](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji) is used in Red Hat / Fedora / CentOS to build RPMs, ISOs, Maven projects and can be extended to build container images

---
# Developer workflow

1. Developer commits a Dockerfile. pushes it and runs `fedpkg container-build`
1. Local plugin is verifying that koji build target (based on the branch name) is valid and creates a `buildContainer` task on the koji
1. [Koji-containerbuild plugin](https://github.com/release-engineering/koji-containerbuild) checks that the image has necessary labels and uses OSBS-client API to start a new build:
    1. OSBS-Client generates a new build json based on the received parameters and internal configuration
    1. OSBS-Client creates a BuildConfig on Openshift with necessary parameters
    1. OSBS-client starts a new build on Openshift cluster and sends logs from the build to the build system
1. Openshift picks the less busy node, starts a new container from the buildroot image
1. The container starts Atomic Reactor, builds the image and runs specified plugins
1. After the build is complete Koji task is finished, a new koji build is created

---
# Orchestration

1. Orchestration workflow allows us to use other Openshift clusters as workers
1. Enables splitting the load, firewalled instances for workers and post-build assembly operations on orchestrator cluster

Example: Multi-arch image building:

1. Orchestrator cluster receives a request for multi-arch build
1. Verifies the source code, fetches packages
1. Picks workers for required architecture - worker_x86_64 and worker_aarch64
1. Workers build images in parallel, push arch-specific images to the registry
1. Orchestrator waits until all workers are finished
1. Orchestrator prepares the multi-arch manifest (manifest list) - a manifest which points to arch-specific image depending on which arch is used on the container engine requesting this image.
1. Orchestrator tags the manifest list, creates Koji build etc.

---
# Chained rebuilds, isolated builds

OSBS leverages Openshift ImageStreams to trigger builds whenever base image is updated:

1. When a child image is built a new imagestream, pointing to a parent build is created
1. Whenever a new parent image version is released, a new Openshift build can be triggered
1. Atomic Reactor has a set of plugins to decide whether the child package should be rebuilt
1. If it indeed should be, a new Koji build is created, as if it was manually triggered

Some tasks, however, require a shortcut version of this workflow - for instance, for quick CVE build.
A special - isolated - build can be created on request. This isolated build would rebuild the same image,
but with different repo with updated packages.
This allows us to release CVE fixes faster.

# Future features

#### Image signing and container scanning

Build phase can be extended to include vulnerability scanning and image signing

#### OCI images

Docker build is implemented as a plugin in Atomic Reactor, so other types of buildstep plugins are possible - to build ansible-container, OCI images (e.g. Flatpaks)
